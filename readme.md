# What is CodeIgniter

CodeIgniter is an Application Development Framework - a toolkit - for people who build web sites using PHP. Its goal is to enable you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to access these libraries. CodeIgniter lets you creatively focus on your project by minimizing the amount of code needed for a given task.

## Release Information

This repo contains in-development code for future releases. To download the latest stable release please visit the [CodeIgniter Downloads](https://codeigniter.com/download) page.

## Changelog and New Features

You can find a list of all changes for each release in the [user guide change log](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/blob/develop/user_guide_src/source/changelog.rst).

## Server Requirements

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance issues, as well as missing features.
